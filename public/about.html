<h1>ðŸŒŸ About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, Iâ€™m Ratna Parihar, a passionate model and visual storyteller driven by creativity, confidence, and connection.</p>
<P>

With a deep love for expressive fashion and camera presence, I bring concepts to life â€” whether itâ€™s through editorial shoots, runway appearances, brand campaigns, or social media reels that leave lasting impressions. My work blends elegance with authenticity, always aiming to evoke emotion and tell a story through every frame.</P>
<p>
Beyond the lens, Iâ€™m someone who believes in the power of transformation â€” in how styling, movement, and attitude can turn any moment into a statement. From traditional wear to contemporary looks, I adapt with precision, bringing energy, professionalism, and heart to every project I take on.</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m currently open to collaborations with photographers, designers, brands, and creative teams who value detail, vision, and originality.</p>
<p>
Letâ€™s create something unforgettable.
